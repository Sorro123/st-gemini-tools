### Structured output usage
The easiest way to use structured output is to go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/u/0/prompts/new_chat, turn on Structured output and edit the structure in the visual editor, then you can easily copy and paste the code from the code editor. Or you can write your own Json or use a premade structure someone else has shared.
